# node-jpegtran-bin [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/yeoman/node-jpegtran-bin.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/yeoman/node-jpegtran-bin)

jpegtran 1.2.90 (part of [libjpeg-turbo](http://libjpeg-turbo.virtualgl.org/)) Node.js wrapper that makes it seamlessly available as a local dependency on OS X, Linux and Windows. Most commonly used to losslessly minify JPEG images.

> libjpeg-turbo is a derivative of libjpeg that uses SIMD instructions (MMX, SSE2, NEON) to accelerate baseline JPEG compression and decompression on x86, x86-64, and ARM systems. On such systems, libjpeg-turbo is generally 2-4x as fast as the unmodified version of libjpeg, all else being equal.


## Example usage

```js
var execFile = require('child_process').execFile;
var jpegtranPath = require('jpegtran-bin').path;

execFile(jpegtranPath, ['-outfile', 'output.jpg', 'input.jpg'], function(err, stdout, stderr) {
	console.log('Image minified');
});
```

You can also run directly from `./node_modules/.bin/jpegtran-bin`


## Dev

Note to self on how to update the binaries.

### OS X and Linux

Run `npm install` to build the binary.

### Windows

- Download the [Windows files 32/64-bit](http://sourceforge.net/projects/libjpeg-turbo/files/) (GCC compiled) on a Windows machine
- Run the downloaded file to extract
- Go to the `bin` folder at the destination and copy `jpegtran.exe` and `libjpeg-62.dll`
