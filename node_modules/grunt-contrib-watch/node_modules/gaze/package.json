  "readme": "# gaze [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/shama/gaze.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/shama/gaze)\n\nA globbing fs.watch wrapper built from the best parts of other fine watch libs.\n\nCompatible with NodeJS v0.8/0.6, Windows, OSX and Linux.\n\n## Usage\nInstall the module with: `npm install gaze` or place into your `package.json`\nand run `npm install`.\n\n```javascript\nvar gaze = require('gaze');\n\n// Watch all .js files/dirs in process.cwd()\ngaze('**/*.js', function(err, watcher) {\n  // Files have all started watching\n  // watcher === this\n\n  // Get all watched files\n  console.log(this.watched());\n\n  // On file changed\n  this.on('changed', function(filepath) {\n    console.log(filepath + ' was changed');\n  });\n\n  // On file added\n  this.on('added', function(filepath) {\n    console.log(filepath + ' was added');\n  });\n\n  // On file deleted\n  this.on('deleted', function(filepath) {\n    console.log(filepath + ' was deleted');\n  });\n\n  // On changed/added/deleted\n  this.on('all', function(event, filepath) {\n    console.log(filepath + ' was ' + event);\n  });\n\n  // Get watched files with relative paths\n  console.log(this.relative());\n});\n\n// Also accepts an array of patterns\ngaze(['stylesheets/*.css', 'images/**/*.png'], function() {\n  // Add more patterns later to be watched\n  this.add(['js/*.js']);\n});\n```\n\n### Alternate Interface\n\n```javascript\nvar Gaze = require('gaze').Gaze;\n\nvar gaze = new Gaze('**/*');\n\n// Files have all started watching\ngaze.on('ready', function(watcher) { });\n\n// A file has been added/changed/deleted has occurred\ngaze.on('all', function(event, filepath) { });\n```\n\n### Errors\n\n```javascript\ngaze('**/*', function() {\n  this.on('error', function(err) {\n    // Handle error here\n  });\n});\n```\n\n### Minimatch / Glob\n\nSee [isaacs's minimatch](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch) for more\ninformation on glob patterns.\n\n## Documentation\n\n### gaze(patterns, [options], callback)\n\n* `patterns` {String|Array} File patterns to be matched\n* `options` {Object}\n* `callback` {Function}\n  * `err` {Error | null}\n  * `watcher` {Object} Instance of the Gaze watcher\n\n### Class: gaze.Gaze\n\nCreate a Gaze object by instanting the `gaze.Gaze` class.\n\n```javascript\nvar Gaze = require('gaze').Gaze;\nvar gaze = new Gaze(pattern, options, callback);\n```\n\n#### Properties\n\n* `options` The options object passed in.\n  * `interval` {integer} Interval to pass to fs.watchFile\n  * `debounceDelay` {integer} Delay for events called in succession for the same\n    file/event\n  * `forceWatchMethod` {'new'|'old'|false} Defaults to `false` to pick the first\n    triggered watch method. Set to `'new'` to only use `fs.watch` or `'old'` to\n    only use `fs.watchFile`. `'old'` is recommended if watch isn't firing or\n    you're watching files over a network.\n\n#### Events\n\n* `ready(watcher)` When files have been globbed and watching has begun.\n* `all(event, filepath)` When an `added`, `changed` or `deleted` event occurs.\n* `added(filepath)` When a file has been added to a watch directory.\n* `changed(filepath)` When a file has been changed.\n* `deleted(filepath)` When a file has been deleted.\n* `renamed(newPath, oldPath)` When a file has been renamed.\n* `end()` When the watcher is closed and watches have been removed.\n* `error(err)` When an error occurs.\n\n#### Methods\n\n* `emit(event, [...])` Wrapper for the EventEmitter.emit.\n  `added`|`changed`|`deleted` events will also trigger the `all` event.\n* `close()` Unwatch all files and reset the watch instance.\n* `add(patterns, callback)` Adds file(s) patterns to be watched.\n* `remove(filepath)` removes a file or directory from being watched. Does not\n  recurse directories.\n* `watched()` Returns the currently watched files.\n* `relative([dir, unixify])` Returns the currently watched files with relative paths.\n  * `dir` {string} Only return relative files for this directory.\n  * `unixify` {boolean} Return paths with `/` instead of `\\\\` if on Windows.\n\n## FAQs\n\n### Why Another `fs.watch` Wrapper?\nI liked parts of other `fs.watch` wrappers but none had all the features I\nneeded. This lib combines the features I needed from other fine watch libs:\nSpeedy data behavior from\n[paulmillr's chokidar](https://github.com/paulmillr/chokidar), API interface\nfrom [mikeal's watch](https://github.com/mikeal/watch) and file globbing using\n[isaacs's glob](https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob) which is also used by\n[cowboy's Grunt](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt).\n\n### How do I fix the error `EMFILE: Too many opened files.`?\nThis is because of your system's max opened file limit. For OSX the default is\nvery low (256). Increase your limit with `ulimit -n 10480`, the number being the\nnew max limit. If you're still running into issues then consider setting the\noption `forceWatchMethod: 'old'` to use the old and slower stat polling watch\nmethod.\n\n## Contributing\nIn lieu of a formal styleguide, take care to maintain the existing coding style.\nAdd unit tests for any new or changed functionality. Lint and test your code\nusing [grunt](http://gruntjs.com/).\n\n## Release History\n* 0.2.2 - Fix issue where subsequent add calls dont get watched (@samcday). removeAllListeners on close.\n* 0.2.1 - Fix issue with invalid `added` events in current working dir.\n* 0.2.0 - Support and mark folders with `path.sep`. Add `forceWatchMethod` option. Support `renamed` events.\n* 0.1.6 - Recognize the `cwd` option properly\n* 0.1.5 - Catch too many open file errors\n* 0.1.4 - Really fix the race condition with 2 watches\n* 0.1.3 - Fix race condition with 2 watches\n* 0.1.2 - Read triggering changed event fix\n* 0.1.1 - Minor fixes\n* 0.1.0 - Initial release\n\n## License\nCopyright (c) 2012 Kyle Robinson Young\nLicensed under the MIT license.\n",
