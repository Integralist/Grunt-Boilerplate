Grunt-Boilerplate
=================

This is a project set-up using Grunt to take case of some standard tasks such as: compiling AMD based modules using RequireJS, watching/compiling Sass into CSS, watching/linting JS code and some other things such as running tests using BusterJS

TODO:

- Install clean up script after RequireJS has run
- Custom task for renaming un/optimised html files
- Figure out how best to optimise images
